# Money Talks: The Untold Truth Behind The Invisible Hand of Market Makers

The files provided within serve as a representation of our final capstone research project. Located on the webpage [here](https://wu-msds-capstones.github.io/money_talks/), you will find an introduction to our market manipulation sensor, as well as some background and history on the evolution of the stock market, the methods we used to complete our research, the data acquired, and the results of our models we created. 

This template already had an orphaned gh-pages repo created, so for it to be published as an HTML file, we activated it in the repo settings and then published it from the Quarto CLI.
