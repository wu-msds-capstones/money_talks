abstract = {Summary
In this perspective, we outline a set of best practices for the planning, writing, and revision of scientific papers and other forms of professional communication in the data sciences. We propose a backward approach that begins with clearly identifying the scientific and professional goals motivating the work, followed by a purposeful mapping from those goals to each section of a paper. This approach is motivated by the conviction that manuscript writing can be more effective, efficient, creative, and even enjoyable—particularly for early-career researchers—when the overarching goals of the paper and its individual components are clearly mapped out.}
