# Introduction

The shift from traditional floor trading to electronic platforms has transformed financial markets significantly. High-frequency trading (HFT) began in the early 2000s and now accounts for up to 70% of US equity trading volume [@Financial_Innovation_2015; @PNAS_2021]. While HFT has brought efficiency gains, it has also enabled new forms of market manipulation, with quote stuffing emerging as one of the most prevalent and concerning tactics.

Quote stuffing is a manipulative strategy where traders rapidly submit and cancel large numbers of orders to overwhelm market data systems and create artificial delays for competitors. Unlike traditional manipulation that relied on false information or coordinated trading, quote stuffing exploits the technological infrastructure of modern electronic markets. Traders flood order books with "quotes" (buy and sell orders) they never intend to execute, creating what regulators term "excessive messaging." This strategy benefits the manipulator by slowing down competing algorithms and creating temporary information advantages through market confusion, effectively giving them millisecond-level trading advantages that can translate to significant profits [@SEC_Risk_Finance_Strategy].

The detection challenge stems from the subtle nature of these attacks - while quote stuffing does disrupt markets, it operates at microsecond timescales within normal market data flows, making it difficult to distinguish from legitimate high-frequency market making activities. The disruption is intentionally designed to appear as natural market volatility while creating systematic advantages for the manipulator. Recent research using Thomson Reuters Tick History (TRTH), a comprehensive database of millisecond-precision market data from 2005-2016, demonstrates that advanced analytical methods are required to differentiate between legitimate trading and manipulative quote stuffing [@MDPI_2022].
