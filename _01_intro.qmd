# 0. Abstract
This study addresses the critical challenge of detecting market manipulation in high-frequency trading environments through the development and implementation of a comprehensive machine learning system. We present a novel approach that combines supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and ensemble methods to analyze multi-source market data in real-time. Our methodology integrates Level 2 (L2) order book data, Level 1 (L1) market data, and OHLCV minute data to create a comprehensive detection framework specifically targeting quote stuffing and related manipulative behaviors.

Using XGBoost as our primary supervised classifier, complemented by DBSCAN for anomaly detection and Random Forest for ensemble predictions, we achieved strong discrimination performance with ROC-AUC ≈ 0.95 on held-out test data. The system demonstrates high recall for manipulation-like quotes (≈ 0.909 on a balanced snapshot) while maintaining manageable false positive rates. Feature importance analysis reveals that spread dynamics, short-horizon volatility, and inter-quote timing patterns are the primary drivers of detection accuracy, aligning with theoretical expectations of manipulation signatures.

Our open-source approach democratizes access to sophisticated market surveillance capabilities and provides a transparent alternative to proprietary "black box" systems. The real-time deployment capability addresses a critical gap in current surveillance systems that typically operate on delayed data, potentially allowing manipulation to continue undetected for hours or days.

# 1. Introduction

Modern financial markets operate at speeds that would have been unimaginable just two decades ago. The shift from traditional floor trading to sophisticated electronic systems has fundamentally changed how securities are bought and sold (Foucault et al., 2013). Today, high-frequency trading (HFT) dominates these electronic markets, accounting for a large share of U.S. equity volume (Aldridge & Krawciw, 2017).

Market manipulation is highly profitable, difficult to detect, and detrimental to market quality. Real-time detection through market data analysis would assist greatly in establishing scope for investigation.

## 1.1 What is Quote Stuffing?

Quote stuffing involves rapidly submitting and canceling large numbers of orders to flood venues and algorithms with short-lived messages, degrading competitors’ information processing. It is often accompanied by temporary spread widening and bursts of order rate (Hasbrouck & Saar, 2013; Egginton et al., 2016).

## 1.2 The Detection Challenge

Patterns emerge and dissipate in milliseconds, data volumes are extreme, and distinguishing manipulation from benign HFT requires microstructure-aware features and time-aware validation (Farmer & Skouras, 3; Laughlin et al., 2014).

## 1.3 Our Approach and Contributions

We combine supervised learning (XGBoost), unsupervised learning (DBSCAN), and a hybrid bottlenecked autoencoder + One-Class SVM pipeline, using L2 marketbook features with supporting L1 and OHLCV context. Key contributions include: theory-aligned features, day-grouped validation, threshold calibration by macro-F1, and deployable artifacts for real-time scoring.
